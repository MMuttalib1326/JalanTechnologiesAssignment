Question 1:
Write a program that takes as input an array of numbers of length N and a number p (positions - p is greater than 0
and less than N) and a number d (direction - either 0 for left or 1 for right). The objective is to return the array
shifted by p positions in d direction.
Example: For an input array [1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6] with p=3 and d=0
the expected result would be [7, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2] with the array shifted left by 3 positions.


Question 2:
Please implement an alarm clock using Object Oriented Programming. If you are not familiar or comfortable with
object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a quick read to ensure you understand it before you
attempt it.
The alarm clock should have the following features:
• It displays the current time
• A user can create any number of alarms by specifying the alarm time and day of the week and time when the
alarm should alert
• A user can snooze an alarm maximum of 3 times at an interval of 5 minutes each.
• A user can delete an alarm
